            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The version control is a system that documents changes to files as it is changed over time. As the file changes, we are able to revert back to its early states thanks to the version control system. Because each state of the file is recorded through "snapshots", each version of the file is safely stored in both your local and remote repositories. However, we must note that Git is one of the many version controls systems avaialable today. Both local and centralized version control systems that use a single server to store files. The downside with this method is that if the server storing the files goes down, the files will be unaccesable. Luckily, we also have distributed version control systems that avoid this problem by "cloning" files. In conclusion, if the remote repository goes down, you will still have access to backed up files in your local computer, or server.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system, so working on files will be both reflected on your local and remote repositories. Because your files will be recoreded in your local repository, you will always have immediate access to the files and will not have to connect with any other server or network in order to access your work. If you use a centralized version control system, you must have internet access to work on your files. Additionally, Git has been built in a manner that makes it nearly impossible to erase or remove data. Git is built in a way that ensures all data added is recorded permanently. This way, we know for sure files have not been removed or erased. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems' work mainly with repositories. There are two types: local and remote. Simply speaking, local repositories are directories stored on your personal computer, or local disk. When using git, files stored in a remote repository are cloned onto your local repository.In order to move files from your local repository to your remote repository, you must use the push command. In order to retrieve a file from the remote repository, you must use the pull command. Lastly, it is important to note that while files are exchanged freely, every version that is changed is recorded for everyone to see.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files can exist in two states when using Git: tracked or untracked. Untracked files are not in the staging area so they are not being recorded, or "tracked" by Git at all. When these files are tracked, they can exist in one of three stages that are vital to understanding how Git works. These stages are unmodified, modified, or staged. When files are unmodified, it means they are being tracked by Git but the file has not been edited yet. Once the file is edited, it becomes a modified file. Finally, when they are staged, you may commit the file and the cycle may be repeated with the same exact file as it becomes modified and staged several times. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Branches.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Branches are used to create tags, or pointers for files. By default, we are given a branch name "master". One can create a new branch by using the "git branch" command. To check what branch you are on, one can quickly use the "git log" command to check which branch you are working on. When you are done working on all branches, you can merge all of the branches to into single file. It is also important to note that the default "master" branch is like any other branch, which is why everyone will have a "master" branch unless they change it.</p>
